# PyBer_Analysis  
## Overview:
V. Isualize, The CEO  of Pyber, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion, needs an Semi-annual analysis on the company's ride-sharing data from January through May of 2019. Presented to her will be full breakdown analysis with visualization of the following:

* Determine the mean, median, and mode for:
    * The total number of rides for each city type.
    * The average fares for each city type.
    * The total number of drivers for each city type.
* A Box-and-whisker plots with determined outliers that visualizes:
    * The number of rides for each city type.
    * The fares for each city type.
    * The number of drivers for each city type.
* A Pie chart that visualizes, for each city type, :
    * The percent of total fares.
    * The percent of total rides.

Rural Cities:
  - The lowest semi-annual revenue of $4,327.93 from 125 total rides, and only 78 total drivers.
  - Averaged the highest median of $34.62 fare per ride and $55.49 fare per driver. 
  
Suburban Cities:
  - Suburban cities coming in second with an semi-annual revenue of $19,356.33 from January to May, 
  - had 625 total rides with only 490 total drivers. 
  - The average fare per ride was $30.97, the average fare per driver came to $39.50 

Urban Cities:
  - Urban city drivers were averaging the least fare per ride at $16.47, with average fare per ride costing $24.50. 
  - Having the highest recorded total rides of 1,625 and almost 1.5 times as many drivers, 2,405, 
  - Urban cities racked up nearly $39,854.38 in total fares from January to May of 2019. 

## Summary

A few recommendations that will balance out the city type disparaties: 
  - Maintain the metrics for the Suburban and Rural cities. These cities are performing efficiently.
  - Decrease the surplus number of drivers for the Urban city type, which will balance out the unused drivers and          increase the fare per driver metric. 
  - Increase the fare per ride in Urban cities to increase the average fare per dirver.
